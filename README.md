# Heroes United X: The Awakening
Heroes United is a multi-level, turn-based browser game that incorporates strategy, wit, and RPG elements. Users are prompted to login or sign up upon load, select and customize
their characters, and unlock new chapters as they progress their way through the story. Characters have preset base stats according to their class, but the extra customization allows users to distribute additional stat points to any selected value.
